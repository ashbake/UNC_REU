LIST OF VARIABLES 
###################################################################
#   Lists variables defined by Ashley in eco_dynmass.py or	  #	
#   from the group finder, fof9.c, or from HAM massmatch3c	  #
#   	     	   	   	      	       			  #
#   Some variables are per galaxy arrays, some are per group	  #
#   For all of Amanda's variables, please see her ECO readme file #

galr			projected distance of galaxy from center of group
galv			line of sight velocity of galaxy minus the mean velocity of its group    
gal_dmass		per galaxy array of dynamical masses for ECO groups in solar mass
gal_vel			per galaxy array of group velocity dispersions
gal_rad			per galaxy array of group average radius
num			number of galaxies in a group. same as ind[i+1]-ind[i]
id			group ID from FOF code
mr			absolute r band magnitude
of			index in original input file
ra			RA
dec			DEC
cz			cz in km/s
ind			indices marking the start of a new group in a per galaxy array. 
			Ex- group = gal_file[ind[i]:ind[i+1]]. gal_file must be ordered by group id
avg_cz			average cz of group. could also be changed to median
avg_ra			average RA of group
avg_dec			average DEC of group
hamass			halo abundance matching masses, per group array
gal_hamass		HAM masses, per galaxy array
hamr200			HAM R200, per group array
gal_hamr200		HAM R200, per galaxy array
r200			R200 calculated from dynamical masses
rvir			1.27 times gal_rad, calculated from the shift between dyn masses & halo masses
